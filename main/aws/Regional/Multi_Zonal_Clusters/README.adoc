= Regional Deployment

This configuration consists of a cluster of nodes that are deployed within one single AWS data center in the ```us-east-1``` region. Each 3 nodes are deployed in a distinct availability zone.

The availability zone ID is assigned to each node. This ID is used to map the node to a physical rack or logical zone. This configuration ensures that leaseholder ranges, the corresponding replicas, and associated endpoints are placed on nodes in different racks/zones.

As per above architecture, we create :

- 1 VPC in us-east-1 with 3 Subnets, each subnet in a different availability zone,
- 3 EC2 Instances per Availability Zone,
- 1 Network Load Balancer to distribute traffic between Availability zones.
